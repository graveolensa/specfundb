specfundb
=========

special functions database

specfundb is intended to be a superset of the material available
in the DLMF, the Atlas of Special Functions, Mathworld, Planetmath,
and so on...

goals:
	hey, I'm using $SOMETHING, what's the syntax for 
	the polylogarithm. Most of the time this means
	lots of annoying web searches and digging through
	documentation and whatnot. (let's make this easy)

	-> to provide a springboard for automated formula
	discovery (you can't really do statistical analysis
	of special functions if you don't have an overarching
	data structure for them
